# JCME
 Javascript City Millenium Edition

Javascipt City Millenium Edition

Is a browser-based JS frontend to view and edit Sim City 2000 save files.

Currently JCME cannot open .sc2 files directly. Instead, a JSON object is input either as a string variable or a file object, generated by OpenCity2K

The project, at this writing, is version 0.1.22.0502. Version number is date in A.B.YY.mmdd format, where A and B are major and minor releases, respectively. Multiple releases on one day append lower-case alphabetical characters, eg 0.1.22.0502a. Branched versions may append the minor release version with an upper-case letter, such as 0.1B.22.0502b (This will probably mostly be for internal versions).

JCME currently does not rely on any external libraries.

As of 2022-04-02, JCME features include:

- load map data from a JSON string variable generated by OpenCity2K by dfloer, available at https://github.com/dfloer/OpenCity2k
    
    
- Recursive search function to locate and/or display individual objects/variables by key
- Alternatively, query game data by object name and location (faster) e.g. City.Misc.Heat (which should return a number such as 100).
- Dynamically write and render HTML UI in JS at runtime.
- In-line text console (currently read-only)
- Write your own page or module script using included functions
- Dark Mode css style
- General layout css

Features currently in-development:

- Render canvas element at runtime
- Import color palette

Future features;

- Tools/toolbar system with included event handling, icons, cursors, etc
